function composedTransform = exampleHelperComposeTransform(baseTransform, relativeTransform)
%exampleHelperComposeTransform Compose two transforms
%   The RELATIVETRANSFORM is added to the BASETRANSFORM and the composed
%   transform is returned in COMPOSEDTRANSFORM.
%   BASETRANSFORM is the transform from laser scan 1 to world and
%   RELATIVETRANSFORM is the transform from laser scan 2 to laser scan
%   1 (as returned by matchScans).
